Secure NodeJS Websocket module. Build using only standard NodeJS library modules. (TLS, HTTPS)

This project is purely designed to be a learning experience for me. There are other very great libraries
for NodeJS that facilitate WebSockets. One of the goals of this project is to only use built in node features,
and to implement the WebSocket protocol myself from the official specification.

It is not a complete implementation, I only add the features that I need when I need them. Currently I've
only used it for my discord bot module nodecord, so if that project didn't require it then it's probably
not in here. I will almost certainly expand and adapt and probably rewrite this in the future.
